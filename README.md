# MCAA_project

Markov Chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) methods to train a perceptron with simulated annealing, where the temperature parameter is lowered progressively. 

Instructions for repository:

Perceptron.py contains the implementation of the MCMC perceptron and its simulated annealing variant. The ipython/jupyter notebooks Project_Simulations_MCMC.ipynb and Project_Simulations_MCSA.ipynb contain the pipelines for standard MCMC and simulated annealing, respectively. The extra_simulations.ipynb notebooks contain some additional simulations contained in the rerport but not appearing in the original notebooks

Warning: Efficient calculation requires installation of ipyparallel and GNU parallel
